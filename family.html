	<h1>The pet owner is relunctant at first to give you up, but eventually agrees with the family that it's best for a cute feline like you. The family successfully purchases you and takes you to their new home. However, the family isn't as loving towards you as you thought. As soon as you get home, the man immediately puts you in the dark and scary basement as your new place to sleep. His wife gives you bland cat food that tastes as worse as dog food. The children, including the daughter tease and make fun of you for being small and often dress you up to make you look silly and laugh.</h1>
	<p>Eventually, as you grow up, you become a cat that turns vicious and mean towards your caregivers. The children now fear you after you tore up the clothing that you were forcibly made to wear. The man's wife screams whenever you pounce at her for not giving you proper food. Finally, as revenge for the man putting you in the dark and scary basement, you sleep on his master bed and force him to sleep on the uncomfortable couch.</p>
	<p>Now that you live with an untolerable fmaily, you might as well stand up for yourself and act tough.</p>
