	<h1>You manage to squeal and run away from the woman holding you. You run as fast as you can until you are caught with a net by an officer. He puts you in his cage and locks you up inside his fan. Fearing for your life, you close your eyes and bark for help to no avail.</h1>
	<p>After you are taken to the pound, the officer brings you to someone that you thought you'd never see again... MOM! She barks happily as you run to her and lick her all over. You bark happily at the officer for reuniting you with your mother and give him some puppy kisses that make him giggle! Finally, as you grow to be a dog, you become the officer's faithful sidekick searching for lost or stray animals that need help.</p>
